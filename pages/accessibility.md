At Visionary Code Works, we are committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone and applying the relevant accessibility standards to guarantee website accessibility for all users.

## Our Commitment

Our goal is to make our website as accessible as possible to people of all abilities and disabilities. To achieve this, we strive to adhere to the following standards:

- **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1**: These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities.
- **Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)**: We use ARIA to improve the accessibility of our web content, particularly dynamic content and advanced user interface controls.

## Accessibility Features

We have implemented several features to make our website easy to navigate and use:

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Our website can be navigated using a keyboard.
- **Text-to-Speech Compatibility**: The site is compatible with text-to-speech software.
- **Alternative Text for Images**: All images contain alternative text descriptions for screen readers.
- **Contrast and Color**: Text and background colors have been chosen to ensure sufficient contrast for readability.
- **Resizable Text**: Text can be resized without impacting the ability to read the content or navigate the site.

## Continuous Improvement

We view accessibility as an ongoing effort and are continuously working to increase the accessibility and usability of our website.
