# Documentation for `_drafts` Directory

The `_drafts` directory in a Jekyll website is a special folder used to store draft posts. Posts in this folder are not published until they are moved to the `_posts` directory.

## Usage

- Place your unfinished blog posts in the `_drafts` directory. These files do not require a date in the filename.
- When you're ready to publish a draft, move it to the `_posts` directory and add the appropriate date to the filename.

## Previewing Drafts

- To preview your drafts as part of the site, you can run Jekyll with the `--drafts` flag. This will build your site with the drafts included as if they were published posts.

## Best Practices

- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review your drafts to either complete or remove them.
- **Consistent Naming**: Use a consistent naming convention for your draft files to easily identify and manage them.
- **Front Matter**: Include front matter in your drafts to make the transition to a published post smoother.
