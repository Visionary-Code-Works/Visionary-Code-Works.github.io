# Documentation for `scripts` Directory

The `scripts` directory in a Jekyll project is typically used for storing custom scripts that automate various tasks related to the development, building, and deployment of your website.

## Directory Structure and Usage

- **Shell Scripts**: Commonly, this directory contains shell scripts (`.sh` files) that can automate tasks like setting up a development environment, running build processes, or deploying the site to production.

- **Ruby Scripts**: For Jekyll projects, Ruby scripts (`.rb` files) might be used for tasks like data manipulation, generating content, or modifying configuration files.

- **Other Script Types**: Depending on the project's needs, this directory may also include scripts written in other languages like Python, JavaScript (Node.js), etc.

## Best Practices

- **Readable and Commented Code**: Ensure that scripts are well-documented and code comments are provided to explain the purpose and functionality of the scripts.

- **Executable Permission**: Make sure that your shell scripts have the appropriate executable permissions set (`chmod +x scriptname.sh`).

- **Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names for your scripts to clearly indicate their purpose.

- **Version Control**: Include your scripts in version control to keep track of changes and allow collaboration.

- **Error Handling**: Incorporate error handling in your scripts to manage failures gracefully and provide useful error messages.

## Example Script Usage

Consider a shell script named `setup.sh` in the `scripts` directory:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script sets up the Jekyll environment
echo "Installing necessary Ruby gems..."
bundle install

echo "Setting up pre-commit hooks..."
# Additional setup commands
```

This script can be run to set up the development environment for new contributors.
